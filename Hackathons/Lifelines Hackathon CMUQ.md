1. ==Findings:==
===============================================================
		1. Trustworthy Health Info RAG Assistant for the Public  
			Why it matters: People need fast advice, but misinformation spreads faster than official updates.  
			What is not fully solved yet: Most chatbots are generic and do not enforce source restrictions, citations, uncertainty labels, or safe escalation. Many solutions exist as pilots, but are not localized, guideline grounded, or monitored for hallucinations at scale.
		2. Concept name (example): CareBridge  ==[https://chatgpt.com/c/696bd02a-928c-8333-a466-97276b537dd9]==
			A crisis health coordination layer that connects the public, CHWs, and clinics using offline workflows and verified guidance.
			
			Module A. Frontline Support, CHW Offline Kit  
			What judges see in demo: a CHW can triage a patient in 60 seconds on a phone, offline, using checklists and decision support.  
			Why it wins: CHW workflow is concrete, realistic, and high impact, and “offline first” shows you understand low resource constraints.
			
			Module B. Care Coordination, Referral Router and Follow Up Loop  
			What judges see in demo: the case becomes a referral, auto routed to the best facility based on simple capacity signals, then tracked until completion.  
			Why it wins: most solutions stop at “referral generated”. Your closed loop (reached or not reached, next step) is a clean innovation judges can grasp.
			
			Module C. Trustworthy Info, Verified Guidance Assistant  
			What judges see in demo: public or CHW asks a question, assistant answers with citations from approved sources, shows uncertainty, and escalates when needed.  
			Why it wins: it directly addresses “trustworthy health information” and shows responsible AI, which judges value.
			
			Why this “single system plus modules” approach is the strongest
			
			1. It maps perfectly to the prompt language. You can literally show a slide with checkmarks for the three focus areas.
			    
			2. It has a clear narrative: person in crisis → CHW triage → referral routing → follow up → education and prevention.
			    
			3. It is demo friendly. Judges reward things they can see working, even if simulated.
			    
			4. It feels “deployable” because you can build it thin. One workflow, three views.
			    
			
			How to keep it tight (so it does not look like too much)  
			Pick one clinical pathway for your demo, for example: fever and respiratory symptoms, dehydration, maternal warning signs.  
			Then implement only the minimum screens:
			
			- CHW triage form + offline save
			    
			- Facility list with “capacity status” toggles
			    
			- Referral creation + status updates
			    
			- Guidance assistant with citations
			    
			
			What is the unique gap you claim  
			Existing efforts exist, but they are rarely all of these at once:
			
			- offline first + closed loop referrals + real time capacity signals + verified citations and uncertainty  
			    Most tools do one piece, not an end to end loop that works under strain.
			    
			
			If you want the highest wow factor in a hackathon, add one extra “judge hook” that is simple:  
			WhatsApp or SMS fallback. If the app has no internet, it can send a compact referral code or summary via SMS or WhatsApp to the clinic. This shows practical thinking without heavy engineering.
