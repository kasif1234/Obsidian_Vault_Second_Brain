If you need further details or specific information on any topic, feel free to ask!
1. ==Findings:==
===============================================================
		1. Trustworthy Health Info RAG Assistant for the Public  
			Why it matters: People need fast advice, but misinformation spreads faster than official updates.  
			What is not fully solved yet: Most chatbots are generic and do not enforce source restrictions, citations, uncertainty labels, or safe escalation. Many solutions exist as pilots, but are not localized, guideline grounded, or monitored for hallucinations at scale.
		2. Concept name (example): CareBridge  ==[https://chatgpt.com/c/696bd02a-928c-8333-a466-97276b537dd9]==
			A crisis health coordination layer that connects the public, CHWs, and clinics using offline workflows and verified guidance.
			
			Module A. Frontline Support, CHW Offline Kit  
			What judges see in demo: a CHW can triage a patient in 60 seconds on a phone, offline, using checklists and decision support.  
			Why it wins: CHW workflow is concrete, realistic, and high impact, and “offline first” shows you understand low resource constraints.
			
			Module B. Care Coordination, Referral Router and Follow Up Loop  
			What judges see in demo: the case becomes a referral, auto routed to the best facility based on simple capacity signals, then tracked until completion.  
			Why it wins: most solutions stop at “referral generated”. Your closed loop (reached or not reached, next step) is a clean innovation judges can grasp.
			
			Module C. Trustworthy Info, Verified Guidance Assistant  
			What judges see in demo: public or CHW asks a question, assistant answers with citations from approved sources, shows uncertainty, and escalates when needed.  
			Why it wins: it directly addresses “trustworthy health information” and shows responsible AI, which judges value.
			
			Why this “single system plus modules” approach is the strongest
			
			1. It maps perfectly to the prompt language. You can literally show a slide with checkmarks for the three focus areas.
			    
			2. It has a clear narrative: person in crisis → CHW triage → referral routing → follow up → education and prevention.
			    
			3. It is demo friendly. Judges reward things they can see working, even if simulated.
			    
			4. It feels “deployable” because you can build it thin. One workflow, three views.
			    
			
			How to keep it tight (so it does not look like too much)  
			Pick one clinical pathway for your demo, for example: fever and respiratory symptoms, dehydration, maternal warning signs.  
			Then implement only the minimum screens:
			
			- CHW triage form + offline save
			    
			- Facility list with “capacity status” toggles
			    
			- Referral creation + status updates
			    
			- Guidance assistant with citations
			    
			
			What is the unique gap you claim  
			Existing efforts exist, but they are rarely all of these at once:
			
			- offline first + closed loop referrals + real time capacity signals + verified citations and uncertainty  
			    Most tools do one piece, not an end to end loop that works under strain.
			    
			
			If you want the highest wow factor in a hackathon, add one extra “judge hook” that is simple:  
			WhatsApp or SMS fallback. If the app has no internet, it can send a compact referral code or summary via SMS or WhatsApp to the clinic. This shows practical thinking without heavy engineering.
			------=======================Extention
										Module A, CHW Offline Kit  
										Offline first mobile flow for CHWs to capture symptoms, vitals, and run quick triage checklists.  
										Saves cases locally, then syncs when internet returns and generates a clean structured case summary.  
										Tech stack: Flutter or React Native, SQLite local storage, background sync to Firebase or Supabase.
										
										Module B, Referral Router and Follow Up Loop  
										Turns the case into a referral, routes to the best facility based on distance, urgency, and capacity signals.  
										Tracks the referral end to end (sent, received, arrived, treated) with reminders and escalation if stalled.  
										Tech stack: FastAPI or Node.js backend, Postgres, simple rules engine, Maps API for distance, web dashboard in Next.js.
										
										Module C, Verified Guidance Assistant  
										Chat interface that answers health questions using only approved sources and local guidelines, with citations and uncertainty labels.  
										Escalates high risk queries to “seek urgent care” or a clinician channel, and provides multilingual responses.  
										Tech stack: RAG pipeline (OpenAI or open source LLM), vector DB (pgvector or Pinecone), curated document store, guardrails plus logging.
										
										If you want, I can compress each into exactly 2 short lines for slide use.

==Research Analysis==


## HPS 1 – Mapping Sanitation and Hygiene Services

## 1. Research and analysis – existing tools

- **Kobo / ODK, UNHCR WASH KAP Mapper, other mobile surveys**
    
    - Kobo/ODK are widely used to collect WASH facility and KAP data offline, then sync when connectivity returns.[](https://im.unhcr.org/apps/mdc-mapper/washkap/)
        
    - Strengths: robust offline forms, standardized indicators, multi‑language support, and integration with dashboards for cluster coordination.[](https://im.unhcr.org/apps/mdc-mapper/washkap/)​
        
    - Failures: data often collected in one‑off rounds, quickly out of date in dynamic camps; enumerator‑dependent workflows limit community reporting and near‑real‑time updates.[](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.07231)
        
- **Community / paper mapping and OpenStreetMap‑based efforts**
    
    - Humanitarian teams and volunteers map latrines, taps and solid‑waste sites onto OSM or custom GIS layers, sometimes informed by UAV or satellite imagery.[](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.07231)​
        
    - Strengths: spatially explicit coverage, can combine with remote sensing to quantify accessibility and degradation over time.[](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.07231)​
        
    - Failures: requires GIS skills and connectivity; updates lag behind real‑world changes; not well linked to feedback from users about functionality, safety, or cultural acceptability.[](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.07231)​
        
- **Remote sensing and cholera/WASH surveillance**
    
    - Recent work uses semi‑supervised segmentation of shelters from UAV/satellite imagery plus overlaid point data on water points and latrines to monitor access and service shrinkage in camps.[](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.07231)​
        
    - Cholera outbreak guidance emphasizes community‑based surveillance, rapid reporting of suspected cases, and WASH situation reports, sometimes using simple phone or SMS channels.[](https://www.rcce-collective.net/wp-content/documents-repo/Cholera_Thematic_Kit/Implementation/GTFCC_Cholera_Outbreak_Response_Field_Manual.pdf)
        
    - Failures: remote sensing does not capture functionality (broken taps, unsafe latrines) or user experience; SMS reporting is rarely integrated into a unified WASH map and can raise privacy and trust issues if not well governed.[](https://www.rcce-collective.net/wp-content/documents-repo/Cholera_Thematic_Kit/Implementation/GTFCC_Cholera_Outbreak_Response_Field_Manual.pdf)
        

## 2. Gap identification (under stated constraints)

- **Staleness in dynamic environments** – most systems capture static snapshots; there is limited continuous, low‑burden updating of facility status as latrines or taps fail or move.[](https://im.unhcr.org/apps/mdc-mapper/washkap/)
    
- **Low‑literacy, low‑connectivity user inclusion** – tools assume smartphone apps or literate enumerators; systematic mechanisms for feature‑phone, icon‑based, or in‑person mediated reporting are weak.[](https://www.rcce-collective.net/wp-content/documents-repo/Cholera_Thematic_Kit/Implementation/GTFCC_Cholera_Outbreak_Response_Field_Manual.pdf)
    
- **Fragmented ownership and data silos** – data are split between WASH agencies, health cluster, government and NGOs with inconsistent formats and access rules, limiting a shared, current map of services.[](https://www.rcce-collective.net/wp-content/documents-repo/Cholera_Thematic_Kit/Implementation/GTFCC_Cholera_Outbreak_Response_Field_Manual.pdf)
    
- **Trust, privacy, and safety** – households may fear that reporting complaints or locations could affect assistance or security; existing platforms rarely provide transparent, community‑understood data‑protection controls.[](https://www.rcce-collective.net/wp-content/documents-repo/Cholera_Thematic_Kit/Implementation/GTFCC_Cholera_Outbreak_Response_Field_Manual.pdf)​
    
- **Limited feedback loops** – communities often do not see how their reports change services, which undermines motivation to contribute data.[](https://www.rcce-collective.net/wp-content/documents-repo/Cholera_Thematic_Kit/Implementation/GTFCC_Cholera_Outbreak_Response_Field_Manual.pdf)​
    

## 3. Ideation – three feasible concepts

## Concept 1 – “Neighborhood WASH Card” (token‑based status mapping)

- **Target users & workflow**
    
    - Camp WASH volunteers and block leaders update status for a small cluster of facilities (e.g., 10–20 latrines or taps).
        
    - Once per day or after an incident, they tap through a very short offline form on a shared low‑cost smartphone or tablet.
        
- **Data capture & trust**
    
    - Pre‑printed facility QR/NFC tags on latrines/taps; volunteer scans tag and selects icon‑based status (working, broken, unsafe, blocked).
        
    - Verification by random supervisory spot‑checks and comparison with remote‑sensing footprints and cholera case alerts.[](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.07231)
        
- **Privacy design**
    
    - No household identifiers; only facility‑level and block‑level data.
        
    - Access controlled dashboards: detailed facility view for WASH cluster; aggregated heat‑map for community notice boards.
        
- **Minimal technical stack**
    
    - Android app built on ODK/Kobo offline forms with QR/NFC support; local SQLite cache and periodic sync via 2G or Wi‑Fi.
        
    - Lightweight web dashboard (e.g., DHIS2 plugin or simple Leaflet map).
        
- **Novelty**
    
    - Shifts from household reporting to **micro‑territory stewardship** with tagged facilities and ultra‑simple icon forms, bridging between remote sensing maps and everyday functionality data.[](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.07231)​
        
- **Evaluation vs success metrics**
    
    - Compare facility list completeness and accuracy against independent WASH assessments over several months.
        
    - Measure median time from failure to first report before/after deployment; track proportion of blocks consistently updating and accessing the map.
        

---

## Concept 2 – “IVR WASH Hotline with Voice Menus”

- **Target users & workflow**
    
    - Any community member with a basic phone calls a free short code to report broken or unsafe WASH points and receive information.
        
    - Interactive voice menus in local languages route reports (water, toilet, waste) and approximate location (block or landmark).
        
- **Data capture & trust**
    
    - Human operator or simple IVR options capture structured complaints; repeat reports from different callers increase confidence.
        
    - Callback or SMS feedback informs reporter when an issue is logged or fixed, demonstrating responsiveness.[](https://www.rcce-collective.net/wp-content/documents-repo/Cholera_Thematic_Kit/Implementation/GTFCC_Cholera_Outbreak_Response_Field_Manual.pdf)​
        
- **Privacy design**
    
    - Caller numbers stored separately from map layer or hashed; reports displayed only as aggregated counts by block.
        
    - Clear audio message at call start describing what is collected and how it is used.
        
- **Minimal technical stack**
    
    - Basic IVR platform (OpenVox/Asterisk or cloud‑based but cacheable), GSM gateway, simple backend to aggregate events into a facility/area status table.
        
    - Data export to Kobo/ODK or GIS dashboard.
        
- **Novelty**
    
    - Combines **low‑literacy IVR** with geocoded WASH mapping, turning voice complaints into structured, mappable signals instead of stand‑alone hotlines.
        
- **Evaluation vs success metrics**
    
    - Track proportion of blocks that generate at least one report in a time window.
        
    - Time from first report to WASH partner acknowledgment; before/after analysis of gap‑detection delays.
        

---

## Concept 3 – “Shared Camp WASH Board” (offline sync kiosks)

- **Target users & workflow**
    
    - WASH agency staff and community focal points periodically sync their offline tablets at solar‑powered kiosks which host a local “camp WASH server”.
        
    - Kiosks display up‑to‑date printed or screen‑based maps for residents.
        
- **Data capture & trust**
    
    - Kobo/ODK forms used offline by multiple agencies; kiosks merge encrypted datasets and de‑duplicate facilities.
        
    - Community meetings review printed maps to validate facility locations and status and annotate corrections.
        
- **Privacy design**
    
    - Kiosk server stores only facility‑level and generalized risk information; household KAP data remain on agency devices or central servers.
        
    - Role‑based access to sensitive layers (e.g., complaints about GBV‑related sanitation risks).
        
- **Minimal technical stack**
    
    - Low‑power mini‑PC or Raspberry Pi with local Wi‑Fi hotspot and offline map tiles; periodic backhaul synchronization when connectivity exists.
        
    - Sync scripts for Kobo/ODK CSVs and shapefiles.
        
- **Novelty**
    
    - Introduces a **physically co‑located, offline “data commons”** for WASH that merges fragmented agency data while visibly feeding back information to residents.
        
- **Evaluation vs success metrics**
    
    - Examine completeness/consistency of facility data before and after kiosk deployment across agencies.
        
    - Measure time from facility failure to appearance on shared board and proportion of agencies regularly syncing.

## HPS 2 – Digital Tool for Safe Childbirth

## 1. Research and analysis – existing tools

- **mHealth voice / SMS interventions**
    
    - Programs like mMitra send timed pregnancy voice messages about ANC visits, danger signs, and newborn care, improving some maternal behaviors in low‑resource settings.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7268375/)​
        
    - Strengths: works on basic phones, supports low literacy via audio, can be localized by language.
        
    - Shortcomings: missed calls, shared phones, and Do‑Not‑Disturb settings reduce reach; asynchronous audio alone may not be enough to change urgent care‑seeking.[](https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2025/1/e65581/)
        
- **Postnatal mHealth and virtual care programs**
    
    - Mixed‑modality programs with live virtual support plus educational messages show better outcomes than one‑way audio alone for infant danger‑sign recognition and clinic attendance.[](https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2025/1/e65581/)​
        
    - Challenges include connectivity, competing household duties, and limited access for women to shared phones, especially when phones are controlled by husbands.[](https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2025/1/e65581/)​
        
- **Humanitarian MNCH and referral systems**
    
    - Emergency MNCH guidance emphasizes the Minimum Initial Service Package, with community mobilization, standardized danger‑sign counseling, and structured referral systems between camps and facilities.[](https://gsdrc.org/publications/maternal-newborn-and-child-health-in-emergency-settings/)
        
    - Evidence reviews highlight persistent gaps in referral coordination, transport, and communication between levels of care in emergencies.[](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hpm.3655)
        

## 2. Gap identification (under stated constraints)

- **Reaching women with low literacy and shared phones** – existing SMS/voice services often assume individual phone ownership and uninterrupted access, which is not true in many crisis shelters.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7268375/)
    
- **Real‑time emergency guidance** – many tools focus on routine messaging rather than rapid assessment and referral when complications occur suddenly at night or during movement.[](https://gsdrc.org/publications/maternal-newborn-and-child-health-in-emergency-settings/)
    
- **Localized, trusted content** – tools are often not tailored to specific cultural norms, languages, and provider networks of each camp or region, which undermines trust and uptake.[](https://gsdrc.org/publications/maternal-newborn-and-child-health-in-emergency-settings/)​
    
- **Privacy and safety in crowded settings** – danger‑sign or pregnancy content on shared devices can expose women to stigma or family conflict; current systems rarely address discreet use.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7268375/)
    
- **Offline resilience** – few solutions are designed explicitly to work offline or with intermittent power, or to blend digital prompts with low‑tech community structures.[](https://gsdrc.org/publications/maternal-newborn-and-child-health-in-emergency-settings/)​
    

## 3. Ideation – three solution concepts

## Concept 1 – “Pocket Birth Card + IVR Companion”

- **User journey in an emergency**
    
    - Pregnant woman or family member uses a simple printed “Birth Card” with icons for common danger signs; in an emergency, they call a toll‑free IVR number printed on the card.
        
    - IVR asks 3–5 yes/no questions via voice menus in local language and classifies urgency, then reads clear next‑step instructions and optionally connects to a hotline or local midwife.
        
- **Content & trust**
    
    - Card and IVR scripts co‑branded by trusted NGOs and local health authorities; content aligns with MISP guidelines.[](https://gsdrc.org/publications/maternal-newborn-and-child-health-in-emergency-settings/)​
        
    - Community health workers (CHWs) distribute and explain cards during ANC visits or outreach sessions.
        
- **Connectivity strategy**
    
    - Offline printed card plus voice hotline; IVR hosted centrally but tolerant of short 2G calls.
        
    - Basic fallback instructions printed on card if hotline unreachable.
        
- **Privacy approach**
    
    - No personal data required; callers may optionally state first name only.
        
    - Card uses neutral symbols rather than explicit “pregnancy” labels to reduce stigma.
        
- **Escalation / referral**
    
    - High‑risk responses route to on‑call midwife, ambulance dispatcher, or referral focal point if available.
        
    - IVR sends structured alert (structured SMS) to facility with risk category and approximate location.
        
- **Evaluation vs metrics**
    
    - Pre/post surveys on danger‑sign recognition among card holders.
        
    - Time from symptom onset to facility arrival compared between users and non‑users during pilot.
        
    - Hotline connection rates and successful referral completions.
        
- **Novelty**
    
    - Couples **physical, low‑tech Birth Card** with a structured IVR triage flow tailored to emergencies, not just routine health promotion.

## Concept 2 – “CHW Offline Birth Companion App”

- **User journey in an emergency**
    
    - Family contacts a nearby CHW (known to them) when complications arise; CHW opens an offline app with pictorial decision trees.
        
    - App guides CHW through danger‑sign assessment and generates an urgency classification plus simple counseling messages.
        
- **Content & trust**
    
    - Content adapted from WHO/IAWG guidelines and validated with local clinicians; CHWs remain the human interface.[](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hpm.3655)
        
    - App displays both text and images; audio prompts available in major languages.
        
- **Connectivity strategy**
    
    - Fully offline on low‑end Android phone; periodic sync when CHW visits clinic to upload anonymized case logs and update guideline content.
        
- **Privacy approach**
    
    - Data stored as household codes, not names; optional notes remain on device until aggregated and de‑identified at sync.
        
    - Device PIN and app‑level lock to protect sensitive notes.
        
- **Escalation / referral**
    
    - App suggests nearest facility with required level of care and prints or shows a short referral code; facility staff see reason for referral.
        
    - CHW can trigger basic SMS to facility when network is available.
        
- **Evaluation vs metrics**
    
    - Compare CHW knowledge and correct danger‑sign classification pre/post training.
        
    - Measure delays to care and facility outcomes for cases managed with the app vs previous practice.
        
    - CHW usability and trust scores.
        
- **Novelty**
    
    - Focuses on **offline, pictorial decision support for CHWs**, explicitly integrating referral codes and low‑tech SMS notification rather than relying on patient‑facing apps.

## Concept 3 – “Discrete Audio Hub” (local content sharing)

- **User journey in an emergency**
    
    - Woman or family member borrows or uses a small shared audio device (e.g., solar MP3 player or cheap feature phone pre‑loaded with content) managed by women’s group or safe space.
        
    - Device menu offers short, pre‑recorded emergency instructions by symptom; user listens privately via earphones and then decides whether to seek help, optionally contacting CHW or hotline.
        
- **Content & trust**
    
    - Messages voiced by local midwives and community leaders, explaining danger signs and emphasizing rights to care, aligned with humanitarian MNCH guidance.[](https://gsdrc.org/publications/maternal-newborn-and-child-health-in-emergency-settings/)​
        
    - Content co‑created with women’s groups to ensure cultural resonance.
        
- **Connectivity strategy**
    
    - Entirely offline audio library updated occasionally via Bluetooth or SD card when staff visit.
        
    - Optional phone numbers for CHWs/hotline read at the end of messages.
        
- **Privacy approach**
    
    - No data collection; device can be used without logging who listens.
        
    - Earphones and neutral device design protect privacy in crowded shelters.
        
- **Escalation / referral**
    
    - Messages instruct users on how to contact CHW networks, safe transport volunteers, or health posts, including night‑time options where available.[](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hpm.3655)
        
- **Evaluation vs metrics**
    
    - Pre/post knowledge surveys in women’s groups; tracking of emergency consultations where the device was used.
        
    - Qualitative feedback on perceived safety, privacy, and usefulness.
        
- **Novelty**
    
    - Uses **shared, offline audio devices as a community asset** for discreet maternal danger‑sign guidance, decoupled from individual phone ownership.

## HPS 3 – AI‑Augmented Emergency Triage & Imaging

## 1. Research and analysis – prior work

- **AI triage in emergency departments**
    
    - Prospective studies show AI models predicting triage levels or critical outcomes with 80–99% accuracy and potential reductions in under‑ and over‑triage when used as nurse decision support.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11771688/)​
        
    - However, studies are almost entirely in high‑income, well‑digitized hospitals with robust EHRs and computing infrastructure.[](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40306071/)
        
- **Interpretable decision support and explainable AI**
    
    - Interpretable CDSS applications use rule‑based logic, feature importance, and natural‑language rationales to support clinicians while maintaining transparency and user control.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11506268/)
        
    - Explainable AI approaches can improve clinician trust when explanations align with clinical reasoning, but overly complex or misleading explanations risk over‑reliance or confusion.[](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-15867-z)
        
- **AI imaging in low‑resource and edge settings**
    
    - AI‑driven low‑dose imaging and enhancement can maintain diagnostic accuracy while reducing radiation and enabling faster reads, with ongoing work on compressing models for standard hardware.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11941271/)​
        
    - Edge‑computing approaches show that compressed models can run on-device or on low‑power processors, supporting diagnostics where cloud access is limited.[](https://www.design-reuse.com/blog/56214-how-edge-ai-is-transforming-medical-diagnostics/)
        
    - Yet, implementation in humanitarian hospitals is largely untested; device variability and power limitations remain major issues.[](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10355450)​
        

## 2. Gap identification for humanitarian deployment

- **External validity and bias** – models trained on high‑income ED data may not generalize to crisis populations with different disease profiles, comorbidities, or documentation patterns.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11771688/)
    
- **Device and site variability** – imaging AI often assumes specific scanner vendors or protocols; humanitarian settings use heterogeneous or older equipment.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11941271/)
    
- **Workflow fit and human factors** – busy ED staff in crises may not have time or training to interpret complex AI outputs; workflow disruptions can negate potential benefits.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11506268/)
    
- **Offline and low‑compute constraints** – many solutions rely on cloud GPUs and continuous connectivity, which are unrealistic during power and network interruptions.[](https://www.design-reuse.com/blog/56214-how-edge-ai-is-transforming-medical-diagnostics/)
    
- **Governance, accountability, and trust** – clear boundaries between AI support and human decision‑making, audit trails, and mechanisms to contest AI advice are underdeveloped, especially in humanitarian contexts.[](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-15867-z)
    

## 3. Ideation – three AI system concepts

## Concept 1 – “Triage+Vitals Edge Assistant”

- **Inputs**
    
    - Initial vitals (HR, BP, RR, SpO₂, temperature), age, sex, chief complaint keywords, simple comorbidity flags.
        
- **Interpretability**
    
    - Two‑stage model: transparent rules (e.g., shock index thresholds) plus a compact ML risk scorer.
        
    - UI shows: overall risk category, top contributing features, and short textual rationale (e.g., “High risk due to hypotension and tachycardia”).[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11506268/)
        
- **Offline / edge operation**
    
    - Quantized model deployed on a rugged tablet or small edge device; all inference done locally with periodic parameter updates.[](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10355450)
        
    - Syncs anonymized summary statistics when connectivity is available for monitoring and re‑training.
        
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop workflow**
    
    - Nurse performs standard triage, then sees AI suggestion; nurse can accept, adjust, or override with mandatory reason logging.
        
    - Overrides feed into model‑monitoring to detect failure patterns.
        
- **Fairness & safety**
    
    - Regular audits comparing performance across age, sex, and displacement status groups; conservative defaults when data missing.
        
    - Hard rules ensure that life‑threatening signs always trigger high‑priority triage regardless of model output.
        
- **Evaluation vs metrics**
    
    - Agreement between AI‑supported triage and reference clinician triage; changes in under‑/over‑triage rates.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11771688/)​
        
    - Time‑motion studies for reduced triage time; usability and trust questionnaires for staff.
        
- **Novelty**
    
    - Designed specifically for **low‑compute, offline EDs**, combining simple transparent rules with a small edge model and explicit override logging to support humanitarian governance.
        

---

## Concept 2 – “Portable Imaging Pre‑Read Helper”

- **Inputs**
    
    - Digital X‑ray or ultrasound images from portable devices; minimal metadata (age, sex, indication).
        
- **Interpretability**
    
    - On‑device model highlights suspicious regions with saliency maps and provides a simple probability of key findings (e.g., pneumothorax, consolidation), plus short textual hints (“Look at right upper lung field”).[](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-15867-z)
        
- **Offline / edge operation**
    
    - Models compressed and deployed directly on portable imaging units or a nearby mini‑PC; no cloud needed for inference.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11941271/)
        
    - When connectivity exists, anonymized images and predictions can be batched to remote radiologists for audit and feedback.
        
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop workflow**
    
    - Frontline clinician reviews image and AI overlay, then records their own interpretation; AI is framed as “second reader”.
        
    - Remote radiologist review (when available) closes the loop and helps refine model via federated or periodic re‑training.
        
- **Fairness & safety**
    
    - Site‑specific validation before use; thresholds tuned to favor sensitivity for life‑threatening findings.
        
    - Monitoring of performance across devices and population subgroups; simple mechanisms to flag and exclude bad scans from training.
        
- **Evaluation vs metrics**
    
    - Sensitivity and specificity for selected findings compared with expert radiologist ground truth.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11941271/)​
        
    - Time from image acquisition to actionable decision; clinician trust/usability scores.
        
- **Novelty**
    
    - Explicit focus on **portable, heterogeneous imaging devices in crisis hospitals**, with on‑device saliency‑based pre‑reads rather than cloud PACS integrations.

## Concept 3 – “Multimodal ED Snapshot Console”

- **Inputs**
    
    - Combined triage data: vitals, brief symptom checklist, comorbidity flags, and binary imaging flags (e.g., “AI suggests abnormal chest X‑ray”).
        
    - Optional free‑text note processed locally by a small language model or rules.
        
- **Interpretability**
    
    - Console displays a ranked queue of patients with color‑coded urgency and a straightforward score breakdown (vitals contribution, symptom contribution, imaging contribution).
        
    - Uncertainty band or confidence indicator; explanations in plain language.
        
- **Offline / edge operation**
    
    - Runs on a low‑power local server in the ED with connected tablets/PCs; no external connection needed for day‑to‑day operation.
        
    - Periodic export of de‑identified logs via USB or intermittent network for oversight and model updates.[](https://www.design-reuse.com/blog/56214-how-edge-ai-is-transforming-medical-diagnostics/)
        
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop workflow**
    
    - Charge nurse monitors queue; can manually re‑prioritize patients and annotate reasons (e.g., social vulnerability, crowding issues).
        
    - Board used during shift handovers and mass‑casualty incidents to maintain situational awareness.
        
- **Fairness & safety**
    
    - Queue display includes safeguards preventing systematic deprioritization of specific demographic groups; optional “equity alerts” if patterns detected.
        
    - Fail‑safe mode: if model confidence low or hardware fails, system reverts to simple ESI‑style rules without ML.
        
- **Evaluation vs metrics**
    
    - Agreement between console urgency rankings and senior clinician assessments; change in door‑to‑provider time.
        
    - User trust and usability ratings; log‑based analysis of how often staff override model suggestions.
        
- **Novelty**
    
    - Moves beyond single‑patient triage to a **whole‑ED multimodal situational‑awareness console** optimized for offline humanitarian settings, with built‑in fairness and override mechanisms.
