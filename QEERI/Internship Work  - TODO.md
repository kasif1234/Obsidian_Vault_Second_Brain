==OBJECTIVES==

These are pointers, take them deep and carry out intricate analysis
1. Implement RAG system in python with local LLM
	1. Output -> JSON with filled parameters
	2. ==Improve Implementation by using given libraires== 
2. Call the graph2table API using snippets
	1. Output -> CSV
	2. ==Research Conductive Polymers Extract them, then do a plot Together==
3. Show to Doctor 
	1. Output -> 20 Figures + JSONS & 1 big graph with all results combined {MATLABS/Excel}
	2. ==Figures + One Main plot + RAG System==
4. Machine Learning Work 
	1. Output -> Predict best Polymer

====
Just extract for now
Later we will find categories
5 columns for text to parse, 5th one being reference
physics informed ML, read till "of" in the title

==Questions==
What are we going to be Predicting?
- What would be considered a “useful” ML outcome from a materials science perspective: ranking, trend discovery, mechanism separation, or performance prediction?
How will translate into a paper?
