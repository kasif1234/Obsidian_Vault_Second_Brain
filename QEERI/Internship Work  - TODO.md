These are pointers, take them deep and carry out intricate analysis
1. Implement RAG system in python with local LLM
	1. Output -> JSON with filled parameters
	2. ==Improve implementation by using given libraires== 
2. Call the graph2table API using snippets
	1. Output -> CSV
	2. ==Research Conductive Polymers Extract them, then do a plot Together==
3. Show to Doctor 
	1. Output -> 20 Figures + JSONS & 1 big graph with all results combined {Matplotlib/Excel}
	2. ==Figures + One Main plot + RAG System==
4. Machine Learning Work 
	1. Output -> Predict best Polymer
