==Paper==: 
**Materials informatics** is ==an interdisciplinary field that applies data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to the study and application of materials science and engineering==. Its primary goal is to accelerate the discovery, design, development, and deployment of new materials by replacing or supplementing traditional trial-and-error methods with data-driven predictions and insights.
